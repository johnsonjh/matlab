 Disclaimer:  Clarkson University has no knowledge or reponsibility for
 the distribution of this software.  Further, the distributor provides
 the software "as is" with no expressed or implied warranty of any kind.
 
 This distribution includes the following files:
 
 MATLAB.EXE     The executable file
 MATLAB.HLP     A simple on-line help system
 MATLAB.DOC     Extensive documentation of program
 README         The file you're reading now
 
 The document file is provided.  However, I created it by formatting
 a XyWrite file to disc; thus, the pagination is thrown off.  If
 you would like the XyWrite source file, send a request via e-mail.
 I strongly suggest that you do not print the entire document.  Only
 the first thirty pages actually deal with using the program (upto
 section 9).  The remaining 30-40 pages are the gorey details on
 how the program was written and an appendix containing the help
 file MATLAB.HLP.
 
 The user interface of this program isn't elegant, but functional.
 I've used it on many occasions without problem.  Hope you find
 it useful.
